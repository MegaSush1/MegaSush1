# Hello I'm MegaSushi
`I'm a novice web designer and c/c++ developper`
<br>
### My language
- C / C++
- Html / CSS / JS
- Python (Recently)
- Assembly (A little bit)

### My goal
Try to make an Operating System and the Kernel that will run on it entirely from scratch ( With help of some friend, of course you don't make an entire os by yourself, and of course you don't make it in one day ).
